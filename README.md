# Why Calgary? We Help!

## Story
Someone from a WeChat lifestyle comes to Calgary (moving or travelling). When they land, they can see the nearby mini-programs available (currently just us!), this could include similar programs for activities, events, immigration...
When someone falls or becomes sick, they will default to looking for services on WeChat - can search in Mandarin or English.

Cases: 
- Call 911 (someone will come and pick you up)
- find clinics vs hospitals 
- info (order of operations for insurance)

## Run
To build and run open in WeChat Dev Tool (微信开发者工具). To download and setup the dev tool, instructions available here:
